## <a name="backgr"></a> Background

The League Championship Series (LCS) 2019 is the annual tournament for the popular online game League of Legends (LoL), made by Riot Games.

I have been interested in how this game is played at a professional level, and so I believe this is an opportunity to not only learn more about it, but a way to improve my own gameplay also.

We conduct exploratory data analysis for post-game match data of the 2019 LCS tournament, looking into which variables significantly affect a match outcome. We also investigate any other relationships between variables.

## <a name="collect"></a> Data Collection

A LCS 2019 dataset was used from http://oracleselixir.com/match-data/, containing match data of all games during the tourney.

Also provided is a dictionary of terms used in the dataset: http://oracleselixir.com/match-data/match-data-dictionary/.
As a result, there may be many terms and jargon, specific to this game used in this report.


## <a name="result"></a> Results
We observe the distribution of game length of the 119 matches played during the tourney. We see that the majority of games are between 25 and 35 minutes, with less greater than 35 minutes, and only a few beyond 50 minutes.

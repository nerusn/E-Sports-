Personal side projects to help me gain understanding and experience of analysing data.


LCS 2019 analysis:

This is a project on analysing the E-Sports tournament of the game League of Legends (LoL).
I use Python (with pandas,matplotlib and seaborn packages) to conduct exploratory data analysis, to investigate any interesting trends.
I look at which variables affect a victory or loss, and at any other intersting pairwise relationships between variables in the dataset.

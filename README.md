# E-sports

LCS 2019 analysis:

I use exploratory data analysis to look at which variables affect the match outcome in a E-Sports tournament, of the game League of Legends (LoL).

Using Python (with pandas, matplotlib and seaborn packages), I also investigate any other interesting trends between variables in the dataset.
